Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since the new wifi in beCentral, it is not possible to have static local ip anymore. Therefore, sometimes the ip of one or several of the SBCs can change.
If the demo doesn't start this is probably the reason.

To fix that problem, double click on the repair icon on the demonstration screen. The script take around 5 minutes to complete.
It look for the new ips of the SBCs on the network and update the configs accordingly.

After running the script you can either click on the nrgcoin icon on the demonstration or unplug and plug the main sbc (connected to the screen) to restart the demo.

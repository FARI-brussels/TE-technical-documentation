Smart Plugs

All demos are wired to electricity through shelly smart plugs. The documentation can be found here.
To access the dashboard, you can download the shelly app or access the web app: https://home.shelly.cloud/
The credentials can be found on the test and experience password vault.
The mac/local ip address pair of each device can be found on the Content Management system under "Device" content type.
As the local ip addresses of the T&E center are not fixed, the ip field is sometimes updated by the start up script.

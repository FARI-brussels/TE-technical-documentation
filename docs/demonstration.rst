Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since the new wifi in beCentral, it is not possible to have static local ip anymore. Therefore, sometimes the ip of one or several of the SBCs can change.
If the demo doesn't start this is probably the reason.

To fix that problem, double click on the repair icon on the demonstration screen. The script takes around 5 minutes to complete.
It looks for the new ips of the SBCs on the network and update the configs accordingly.

After running the script you can either click on the nrgcoin icon on the demonstration screen or unplug and plug back the main SBC (connected to the screen) to restart the demo.

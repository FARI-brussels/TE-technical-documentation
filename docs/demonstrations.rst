Brain computer interface
------------------------


Smartgrid
---------
Smartgrid showcase a multi-agent-based system for trading ’green’ energy using a bitcoin like currency called “NRGCOIN”. The goal being to maximize local exchange by encouraging local consumption of green energy.
The demo represents an arbitrary large local neighbourhood exchanching green energy locally and grey energy with the external network.


Possible harware configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Each household is defined by two variables : production, consumption
2. The consumption is taken from existing simulations (from file)
3. The production can either be taken from existing simulations  (fully simulated), from the solar pannel production, or from light sensor measure. A mix of the three strategy can also be used but then, each source should be normalized. 

Possible network configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. The simulation can run on a single rpi of odroid but then it allows two display max. (This is how it is currently running).
2. The other opposite is to run the simulation with one rpi of odroid per household or substation. The we can have one display per agent. (This is how the simulation was running before Phil asked to disconnect it)
